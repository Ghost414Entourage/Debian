The configuration files for libvirt are stored under  /etc/libvirt, while VM definitions are usually kept in  /etc/libvirt/qemu/. 

sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER 

Virtual disks are stored as image files, usually in  /var/lib/libvirt/images/

Virtual Disk Formats (qcow2, raw, vmdk)  


Virtual disks are files that act like physical hard  drives for virtual machines. When a VM boots, the  hypervisor presents the virtual disk as though it were  a real drive, but behind the scenes it is simply reading  and writing to a file on the host system. The format  of this file determines how the virtual disk behaves  in terms of performance, features, and compatibility.
